	    <h2>Design Justifications</h2>
		<p>The colour scheme of the website features mainly orange shades. This is because the logo of the restaurant is the first thing I designed. I really liked the orange shadows of the lettering, which is why this shadowing techinique is consistently used for the style of the headings. The primary font chosen for the website is Lato, as I find the style of this font lends a very modern and aesthetic to the written content of the website. The orange colour theme is also persistent in other elements of the website, such as the buttons, in order to establish thematic consistency. An example of the heading and button design can be found below.</p>

        I included a recurring jumbotron on the site displaying a colorful image of a restaurant overlooking the Nieuwe Maas in Rotterdam. I feel this image best represents type of environment the restaurants would be located in, as well as reflecting the look and feel of company. There are also some other visuals of restaurants that are meant to represent other locations of the business, as well as very sharp and colorful images of seafood dishes, primarily on the menu page.

        The vocabulary used for most of the written content is welcoming and positive, making use of many adjectives to emphasize the beauty and grandure of the restaurant. The language used is quite simple, but not too simple that it reflects negatively on the image of the brand. I added some quotes and stories from the company's "founder" to create a feeling of familiarity amongst visitors. I there to be a balance between text and visuals, as I think it is pleasing on the eye and makes the website more engaging.

        I wanted to include some fun functional elements on every page, in order to increase engagement amongst visitors. These elements inlude the carousel on the <a href="testimonials.html">Testimonials</a> page, which switches between testimonials and can be controlled by the user, as well as the collapsing paragraphs, which is included in the <a href="about_us.html">About Us</a> page (and here). Experimenting with elements like these makes every page feel fresh and interesting. Howver, I feel these elements have to be suitable for the content of the page and cannot just be placed at random.

		<h3>Website Testing</h3>
		<p>The website was tested by three of my friends, with whom I shared the url to the homepage. They tested it on both phone and desktop compatibility. The desktop compatibility was really well received, as they could find no functionality issues on any of the pages.</p>
		<p>On smartphones, the website was functionally less optimal. Most of the flaws originated from the About Us page, which featured some issues with the Google Maps extention on the page, which transcended smartphone border limits on the right. A little bit lower on the page, the jumbotron of the "founder" of the company also lacked compatibility on the smartphone, with the image being cut in half and only featuring the left side.</p>
		<p>Functionally, though, all the links and buttons that are meant to be active are working well. The navigation bar is also completely functional, but was lacking a visual spark according to some testers.</p>

	    <h2>Personal Recommendations for Improvement</h2>
		<p>My ideal version of the website would look a lot different, but I am personally quite happy with how it turned out. Ideally I would have liked more fluency between sections and columns, sometimes it feels like there are certain elements missing, I just don't know how to implement them. Especially in the sections featuring text, I feel the design is quite flat. The segmentation and implementation of images I feel is a lot better. I would have like to give the navbar better detailing, but could not figure out how to get it to work with causing errors.</p>
