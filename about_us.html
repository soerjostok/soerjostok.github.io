	    <h2>Our Founder</h2>
		<p>Arthur Curry was born in Portland, Maine, where, as a child, he helped his fisherman father bring the daily catch to the market. At the age of thirteen, he started working at a seafood bar, where the experienced head-chef took him under his wing. An promising young protege, Arthur learned the tricks of the trade from his Hawaiian mentor. At the age of 28, Arthur Curry opened his first restaurant and the rest is history.</p>
		<p>"Cooking food is not about knowledge or talent, but about passion and experimentation."</p>
